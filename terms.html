    <p>Nouriva provides informational and educational content only. It is not medical advice and does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

    <h2>7) Your Content</h2>
    <p>You may submit content such as meal entries, photos (if used), voice input (if used), ratings, and other data ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content.</p>
    <p>You grant Nouriva a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, process, reproduce, and display User Content only as needed to operate the Service and provide features you request (including processing via third-party AI services).</p>

    <h2>8) AI Features and Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>AI-generated outputs and nutrition estimates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate for your circumstances,</li>
        <li>are not a substitute for professional advice, and</li>
        <li>should be used with judgment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for your decisions and actions based on the Service.</p>

    <h2>9) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including its software, design, text, graphics, and trademarks, is owned by Nouriva or its licensors and is protected by law. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service except as permitted by law or with our written permission.</p>

    <h2>10) Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may rely on third-party services (including Firebase, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Apple). We are not responsible for third-party services, and your use of them may be subject to their separate terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>11) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE.</p>

    <h2>12) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOURIVA WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOURIVA'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR (B) $50.</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>13) Indemnification</h2>

    <h2>14) Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the Service. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive (including disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification).</p>

    <h2>15) Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the Effective Date. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>16) Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service will be brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, and you consent to that jurisdiction and venue, unless applicable law requires otherwise.</p>
