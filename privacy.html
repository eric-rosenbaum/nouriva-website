        <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 21, 2025</p>
        <p class="meta"><strong>App:</strong> Nouriva ("Nouriva," "we," "us," or "our")<br>
        <strong>Operator:</strong> Nouriva is operated by an individual sole proprietor based in New York, New York, United States.<br>

    </div>

    <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>A. Information you provide</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Account information:</strong> email and basic account identifiers.</p>
    <p><strong>User inputs and wellness data:</strong> meals you log; meal labels (e.g., breakfast/lunch/dinner); goals you select; self-ratings (e.g., energy/sleep); and other information you enter (such as weight, if you choose to log it).</p>
    <p><strong>Support communications:</strong> information you include if you contact us.</p>
    
    <p><strong>B. Photo and voice inputs (if you use those features)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Meal photos:</strong> if you use photo logging, you may upload a photo to be analyzed to create a meal log and nutrition estimates.</p>
    <p>We do not store meal photos on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Voice inputs:</strong> if you use voice logging, you may submit audio to be processed into a meal entry.</p>
    <p>We do not store voice recordings on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Even though we do not store photos or voice recordings, the third-party services that process them (described below) may temporarily process and retain data according to their own policies and settings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>C. Information collected automatically</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Device and usage data:</strong> app interactions, approximate location derived from IP address, device type, operating system version, app version, and diagnostic data (such as crash logs).</p>
    <p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> analytics and device identifiers used for performance, debugging, and analytics.</p>

    <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the Service (create meal logs, show dashboards, generate nutrition estimates, and display insights).</li>
        <li>Personalize the Service (goal-based insights, nutrient focus, trends).</li>
        <li>Improve reliability and performance (analytics, debugging, crash reporting, feature improvement).</li>
        <li>Provide support and communicate with you (service messages and responses to inquiries).</li>
        <li>Protect the Service (security, fraud/abuse prevention, enforcing our Terms).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) AI Processing and Nutrition Estimates</h2>
    <p>Nouriva uses third-party AI services to analyze information you submit (such as meal text, meal photos, and voice input) to generate structured meal logs and nutrition-related estimates.</p>
    <p><strong>What we send for processing:</strong> text you enter for meals; meal photos if you choose photo logging; and audio if you choose voice logging.</p>
    <p><strong>What we store:</strong> we store the results of the processing (for example, detected foods, estimated nutrients, and classifications) so they can appear in your history, dashboard, and insights.</p>
    <p><strong>What we do not store:</strong> we do not store meal photos or voice recordings on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Nutrition estimates and insights are informational and may be inaccurate. They are not medical advice.</strong></p>

    <h2>4) How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We share information only as needed to operate the Service:</p>
    <p><strong>Service providers (processors):</strong> We use third-party providers to host and operate core app infrastructure, analytics, and AI processing. These providers process information on our behalf.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal and safety reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, users, and the Service (e.g., fraud prevention, security incidents).</p>
    <p><strong>Business transfer:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

    <h2>5) Third-Party Providers</h2>
    <p>We use the following categories of third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> authentication and/or analytics and/or crash reporting (depending on your device and configuration).</li>
        <li><strong>AI processing providers:</strong> OpenAI and Google Gemini (for meal interpretation and enrichment).</li>
        <li><strong>Apple:</strong> in-app purchases and subscription status.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers may process information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your account data and logged results for as long as your account is active so the Service works as expected.</p>
    <p>If you delete your account in-app:</p>
    <p>We will delete or de-identify your account data and stored results within a reasonable period, typically within 30 days, unless retention is required for legal, security, or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
